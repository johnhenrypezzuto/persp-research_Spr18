# Problem set #1

## Part 1: Write a data section for your assigned data set (5 points)

![Not this Data.](http://www.startrek.com/uploads/assets/db_articles/e81c754bada3cc253e296896254bbe73916ac363.jpg)

Your assignment is to write a data description of a paper for your assigned dataset from the list below. We'll forgo the methods component since you don't have a specific research question or methodology. Your write up should have the following properties:

1. Describe how to access data, where it is stored, who curates it. Make sure to use the original source and curator in addition to the NBER site to which I have linked.
1. Cite other key papers that have used this data.
1. Describe how the data were collected.
1. Include a table that gives descriptive statistics for at least 8 key variables (you can do more).
1. Include at least one key visualization of the data that exhibits an interesting characteristic.
1. Show at least one conditional (slice) description of the data (e.g., all variable descriptive statistics by nationality of survey respondent). This can be a table or visualization.
1. The above requirements are the minimum. Feel free to go beyond these if you feel you can describe some interesting characteristics of the data.
1. A PDF of your data description section should be uploaded into your `ProblemSets/PS1` folder of your GitHub project repository by 11:30am on Monday, April 16.

## Part 2: Critique a computational research paper (5 points)

Your assignment is to write a critical review of the main computational/empirical approach to answering the research question in your assigned paper from the list below. Your critical review has no page minimum or maximum. But it should have the following components:

1. State the research question of your assigned paper.
1. What data did the paper use?
1. What theory did the paper reference in order to interpret the data? (Note: it is possible that the paper has no reference to theory.)
1. Was your assigned paper a descriptive study, an identification exercise, a numerical solution to system of equations study, or some combination of the three? (These are the three classifications we discussed in class.)
1. What computational methods did this paper use to answer the research question? What was their result or answer to the question?
1. Think of yourself as an academic referee. Give two suggestions to the author(s) of your assigned paper of things the authors might do to improve their results or strengthen their evidence for the answer to the question.
1. A single document (e.g. `.md`, `.pdf`) of your answers to the components above should be uploaded into your `ProblemSets/PS1` folder of your GitHub project repository by 11:30am on Monday, April 16.
